# ComputerVISION-PROJECTS

# 🧠 Beginner Computer Vision Projects

This folder contains my beginner-level computer vision projects.

These projects are part of my learning journey as I explore computer vision concepts, practice Python, and understand how visual data can be processed and analyzed. Each project focuses on different aspects of computer vision, and more projects will be added over time as I improve.
